        <p>Hi my name is Jhei Salvatierra, I live in the Southern part of the Philippines. I like to read books, watch
            films, play games, and go out on runs. I'm excited to relearn HTML and CSS and discover new knowledge that
            would help me better grasp the fundamentals of web development.
